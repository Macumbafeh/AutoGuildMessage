# AutoGuildMessage
Automatically sends a predefined, random welcome message to a new guild member from a list of user entered, custom welcome messages.
Allows the user to assign up to 10 random welcome messages where 1 of these messages will be selected at random and will be sent to Guild chat to welcome a new member of the guild automatically.

The purpose of this AddOn is to make it look like you are not using an AddOn to welcome new players or congratulate guild members automatically. 

## Commands
`/agm show welcome` - Shows the complete list of 10 messages.

`/agm set welcome [1-10] [new message]` - Allows you to replace 1 of the 10 messages to a new predefined message

Note: Do not include square brackets with the slash commands!

__Example slash command__: 

`/agm set welcome 4 welcome man!`


this version can't display a GZ message since it's based on achievement which doesn't exists on TBC.
